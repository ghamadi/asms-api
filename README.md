# API for asms backend service

This is my very first attempy at a backend application. It is part of a full-stack project with a single user and no need beyond use on localhost. 

It is now in the process of being depracated in favor of a more stable, multi-user version that is intended for commercial use upon production.

The source code is open now for demonstration purposes only. Documentation of the API endpoints will follow.
